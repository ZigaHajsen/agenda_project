# agenda_project

To start the project you will need .env file inside server directory with NODE_ENV variable set to development or production, 
PORT variable is optional as it defaults to 5000 and a MONGO_URI variable that connects you to your mongoDB server.

When setup is complete you can run both server and client by writing npm run dev from the terminal in the root directory.
